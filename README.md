# Introduction 
This repo represents the solution for Assignment 2 for SWE 6733. This assignment requires our team to perform mob programming to test, refactor and a feature to the Gilded Rose refactoring kata. Our team chose to modify the code in the Java language using the IntelliJ IDE.

# Face to Face Collaboration Tool
Our team used Microsoft Teams to virtually meet and record our mob programming sessions. https://teams.microsoft.com/
